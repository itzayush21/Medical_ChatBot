This repository showcases the fine-tuning of the aboonaji/llama2finetune-v2 model on specialized medical datasets to create an AI-powered conversational assistant for healthcare. By leveraging techniques such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, this project aims to deliver accurate, context-aware responses in the medical domain. The chatbot is designed to aid in patient interaction, preliminary symptom checks, and medical knowledge dissemination. Explore the codebase to see how state-of-the-art NLP meets healthcare innovation!
